 * The door's connection file, `<app>/.acryl/door.json`: where the running app listens and this run's secret, for the operator client in

 *
 * Protection: on macOS and Linux the folder is `0700` and the file `0600`, so only the OS user who started the app can read it. On
 * Windows file modes mean nothing; the file is protected by where it lives, the app folder in the user's profile, whose ACL gives access
 * to that user, SYSTEM and Administrators only. The door does not widen it. The folder also carries its own `.gitignore` of `*`, so
 * `git add -A` never stages the secret even in an app whose `.gitignore` lacks the `.acryl/` line.
