# Specification Quality Checklist: Development Canvas

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before planning
**Created**: 2026-08-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

Note: Assumptions mention Desktop advanced mode and a later package extraction. Those are product boundaries, not a React/Node how-to in the requirements list.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Informed defaults: Chat-as-tile, allowlisted agent CLIs, in-memory file buffer, iframe browser, first slice inside Desktop advanced shell.
- Orca worktrees / Design Mode / mobile are out of scope.
