# Tasks: the framework's own architecture (spec 049)

**Feature**: `specs/049-framework-architecture/` | **Input**: [spec.md](./spec.md), [plan.md](./plan.md)

**Conventions**
- Tickets found while building a slice, recorded where the slice's decisions live. Each names who found it, when, and the owner's or
  the coordinator's decision on it.
- The acceptance criterion of a ticket is the test or check it names; it is done when that passes on `main`.

## Open

- [ ] T001 [found 2026-10-27, slice 17 commit A, AcrylImplementer; coordinator: yes, low priority, after M6] Live activation of an
  `acrylblends` module. An app plugin installed into a running app that declares an `acrylblends/cordis/...` module in
  `dsh.requiresAcrylPackages` gets it linked into the profile, and it is used when its row is already mounted. When it is not, the live
  install path of `acryl-plugin-context` (`materializeRequiredAcrylPackages` in `plugins/acryl-plugin-context/lib/install.js`) refuses
  with what to do, and the module mounts at the next start: an `acrylblends` module is not a DSH bundle, so `ensureProfileBundle` and
  `live.activate` do not apply to it. The refusal and the restart are fine until this ticket.
  Wanted: the running app inserts and activates the module's row (id and name the module, package `acrylblends`) through the Loader,
  with the same reload and rollback the bundle path has.
  Done when: a test installs, into a running app, a plugin that requires `acrylblends/cordis/state` while no row for it is mounted, and
  the plugin's `ctx.state` works without a restart; a second install of a plugin requiring it adds no second row; uninstalling both
  leaves the row as it was before.

### M10 - the Blank app, prebuilt for every desktop (owner, 2026-11-03)

Owner's words: "we should have acryl pre-built Blank version of empty desktop App for macOS arm/intel, windows intel, linux ubuntu
arm/intel for acrylblends Blank app so that we download it and it's easiest for user to start building. no flags, no nothing, no installs
of weird packages. for non-tech it'd be ideal start point." Recorded by AcrylImplementer.

- [ ] T002 [M10] The Blank app as a desktop product: the Blends frame around an empty `acrylblends` Blank app, packaged with its own
  runtime (Node or Electron's, git included or not needed), so it starts from the downloaded file alone. Where each app keeps its source, data,
  cache and logs is `app-storage.md` in this folder (one sealed folder per app in the product's per-user app data root, the same layout on every OS,
  decided in the `AppInstance` family, never `homedir()` or Documents); the person names the app on first start.
  Done when: on a clean user account with no Node, git or npm, opening the app shows the frame with the Blank app running in it.
- [ ] T003 [M10] First start asks nothing technical: no flag, environment variable or terminal command. A model is chosen in the app's own
  Settings (sign in, or paste a key), and until one is set the chat says how in one sentence.
  Done when: the T002 walk reaches a working chat by pressing only the app's buttons.
- [ ] T004 [M10] Builds in CI for macOS arm64 and x64 (signed and notarized DMG), Windows x64 (signed NSIS installer) and Ubuntu arm64
  and x64 (`.deb` and AppImage), attached to one release page with a plain download table.
  Done when: one tag produces all five downloads and each one's size is on the page.
- [ ] T005 [M10] A first change from the chat lands in the app: asked in the chat, the agent builds it through the door, the canvas shows
  it, and a Save point records it, all without a restart.
  Done when: the same walk on each OS ends with the change visible and saved.
- [ ] T006 [M10] Updates without reinstalling: the app checks its release page and offers the new version; the person's app folder is
  kept across the update.
  Done when: installing version N, building a change, then updating to N+1 keeps the change and the chat history.
- [ ] T007 [M10] Hand walk per OS: this Mac (arm64, and x64 through Rosetta or an Intel build), mbpi9win (Windows), z370n (Ubuntu x64)
  and an Ubuntu arm64 machine, each from the downloaded file on a fresh account; screenshots of each step for the workshop handout.
  Done when: the five walks pass and their screenshots are in the handout.

`acryl control list` not seeing an app started with an explicit home, found by the same slice, is in spec 048's ticket
[T011](../048-ide-on-framework/tasks.md).
