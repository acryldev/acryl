# Tasks: the framework's own architecture (spec 049)

**Feature**: `specs/049-framework-architecture/` | **Input**: [spec.md](./spec.md), [plan.md](./plan.md)

**Conventions**
- Tickets found while building a slice, recorded where the slice's decisions live. Each names who found it, when, and the owner's or
  the coordinator's decision on it.
- The acceptance criterion of a ticket is the test or check it names; it is done when that passes on `main`.

## Open

- [ ] T001 [found 2026-10-27, slice 17 commit A, AcrylImplementer; coordinator: yes, low priority, after M6] Live activation of an
  `acrylblends` module. An app plugin installed into a running app that declares an `acrylblends/cordis/...` module in
  `dsh.requiresAcrylPackages` gets it linked into the profile, and it is used when its row is already mounted. When it is not, the live
  install path of `acryl-plugin-context` (`materializeRequiredAcrylPackages` in `plugins/acryl-plugin-context/lib/install.js`) refuses
  with what to do, and the module mounts at the next start: an `acrylblends` module is not a DSH bundle, so `ensureProfileBundle` and
  `live.activate` do not apply to it. The refusal and the restart are fine until this ticket.
  Wanted: the running app inserts and activates the module's row (id and name the module, package `acrylblends`) through the Loader,
  with the same reload and rollback the bundle path has.
  Done when: a test installs, into a running app, a plugin that requires `acrylblends/cordis/state` while no row for it is mounted, and
  the plugin's `ctx.state` works without a restart; a second install of a plugin requiring it adds no second row; uninstalling both
  leaves the row as it was before.
  Mini-design: [plan.md, T001](./plan.md#t001---live-activation-of-an-acrylblends-module-2026-10-28-acrylimplementer-mini-design).

`acryl control list` not seeing an app started with an explicit home, found by the same slice, is in spec 048's ticket
[T011](../048-ide-on-framework/tasks.md).
